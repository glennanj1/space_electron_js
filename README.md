# Electron JS

Destop app that works on MacOS, Linux and Windows. Utilizing api calls to open-notify.org this is a test app to prepare me for writing my next desktop app google anylitics api. My goal is to have an app that is local and not just on the web. Some features I like are being able to make custom UI components on your own desktop without touching a web browser. HOW COOL! Electron JS is just another reason I love javascript. Feel free to clone this down and play around with it. It is easy enough to just follow the docs as I did, but I have get requests set up for easier api calls. Thanks for visiting!

# JavaScript is awesome...
